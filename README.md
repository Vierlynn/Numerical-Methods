# Class: Numerical-Methods
This repository contains algorithms, source codes, and examples of cases that can be solved using numerical methods. The materials and algorithm are provided by Dr. Putu Harry Gunawan which is my lecturer for this class. Most of them will be written in Python using google colaboratory so feel free to try it yourself.


## Outlines will be updated soon
